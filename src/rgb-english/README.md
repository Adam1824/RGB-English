# RGB-English
In CSS, RGB values are represented using hexidecimal, e.g  **#FFFFFF**.
This program is going to match english words to hexidecimal colour codes, from...
**#000000** to **#FFFFFF**
## Assumptions
1. The word is between 2 and 6 characters
2. A character will either be A-F or one of the following numbers that represents a letter
  - 1 = I
  - 3 = E
  - 4 = A
  - 5 = S
  - 7 = T
  - 8 = B
4. Any words less than 6 characters have the rest of the value filled with 0's to make the colour, e.g **#CA7000**
